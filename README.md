## GitHub Repository: SMSSpamClassification

### Description
**SMSSpamClassification** is a machine learning project focused on categorizing SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). Leveraging the SMSSpamCollection dataset, the project employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF vectorization, to extract meaningful features from the text data. A Logistic Regression model is trained on these features to build a robust spam detection classifier.
